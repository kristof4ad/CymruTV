It is in the Guinness Book of Records for being the place with the longest name in Britain.\n\nThe name means \"St Mary's church in the hollow of the white hazel near to the fierce whirlpool and the church of St Tysilio of the red cave\" in Welsh. It was invented in the 1860s by a local tailor to make the village famous for having the railway station with the longest name.\n\nEnglish speakers (pronounce ch as in \"Loch-Ness\") saying \"Thlan-vire-poothl-gwin-githl-go-ger-i-chwen-drob-oothl-landus-ilio-goh-goh-goch\" will sound close to how it is meant to sound although the double L sound is difficult to recreate.", imageName: "llan.jpg"),

Often colloquially known as Aber, it is located near the confluence of the rivers Ystwyth and Rheidol. Although the name may seem to suggest otherwise, only the River Rheidol passes through the town; following the reconstruction of the harbour, the River Ystwyth skirts the town.\n\nSince the late 19th century, Aberystwyth has also been a major Welsh educational centre, with the establishment of a university college there in 1872.\n\nAberystwyth has a pier and a fine seafront which stretches from Constitution Hill at the north end of the Promenade to the mouth of the harbour at the south, taking in two separate beach stretches divided by the castle. Today it is essentially made up by a number of different areas: Aberystwyth town, Llanbadarn Fawr, Waunfawr, Penparcau, Llanbadarn and Trefechan, with Penparcau being the most populous.", imageName: "aber.jpg"),
             Place(title: "Cardiff", summary: "The King of Wales lives here!", fullDescription: "Cardiff is the capital and biggest city of Wales, in the United Kingdom.\n\nIts name in the Welsh language is Caerdydd. A 2011 census reports that around 346,100 people live in Cardiff. It is the most important city in Wales for tourism, culture, government, sport, transport, nightlife and business.\n\nCardiff has a big port that used to be known as Tiger Bay. It is now just called Cardiff Bay, and the Welsh government works there. There are now lots of shops, pubs and restaurants in Cardiff Bay. Cardiff has an international airport, and is twinned with Nantes in France and Stuttgart in Germany. Cardiff has one of the largest stadiums in the United Kingdom, the Millennium Stadium, where important world sports matches and concerts happen. Other big stadiums in the city are the Cardiff City Stadium, where the main football team play, Cardiff Arms Park where the main rugby team play, and the SWALEC Stadium where cricket is played.", imageName: "cardiff.jpg")
